In the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5h3yTxeCew) and in his book "Things To Make And Do In The Fourth Dimension", Matt Parker poses the question of how to hang a picture on $n$ pegs in such a way that removing any one of the pegs causes the picture to fall down. He gives a recursive method for doing so, but this method seems very inefficient in that it uses approximately $n^2$ loops around the pegs. In the video he speculates that a much more efficient solution should exist. This repository investigates the minimum number of loops required to solve the problem for various small $n$.
